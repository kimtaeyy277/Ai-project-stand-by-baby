Proposal: 
The title of our team is baby care stand by baby
Our team chose option 1, and we are planning to carry out a project to link NUGU AI speaker with LG appliance. (AI + LG appliance). 
Among many LG home appliances, we decided to use Stand by me to do this project. 
Like the title mentioned earlier, our project goal is baby care using standby me. Many couples find it difficult to put their babies to sleep.
Couples are also very worried about whether their baby is sleeping well or if the baby is not sick while sleeping. 
So we're going to develop a service that can relieve the parenting stress from putting these babies to sleep.
We thought about <What helps a baby sleep?>. Our team searched for various data, and was able to found one research.
According to a published study, babies affected by white noise fell asleep faster.
At that time, the research team conducted a survey of 40 newborns and confirmed that 80% of the babies in the subjects fell asleep in five minutes in a white 
noise environment.
It is said that the baby can have a significant effect because it is already exposed to sounds similar to white noise from the mother's womb.
The artificial intelligence speaker recognizes the baby's sleeplessness through the baby's crying and tries to create a function that tells the baby white noise.
In addition, there is a function to play a baby's favorite song or video, and these functions can reduce the baby's anxiety and stress. 
We believe the project will help reduce the stress and anxiety of parents raising babies and help their babies sleep well.
